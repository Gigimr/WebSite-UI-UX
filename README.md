# React + Vite

## Project name:
React + Vite + Tailwind WebSite UI/UX

## Project description:
This project is a starter template for building React applications using Vite. Vite is a super-fast build tool that offers a modern development experience with instant server start, lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized production builds.
